### 2017-09-18: Distant reading

New York Times Reading

“We need distant reading, Moretti argues, because its opposite, close reading, can’t uncover the true scope and nature of literature.”
Moretti believes that rather than helping us as readers, close reading can actually hinder us because we will have details rather than a full scope of literature. I was confused as to why Moretti would think this from merely the definition of distant reading. This did help make his point clearer.. As readers, many times we do get wrapped up in the details of books and then forget to analyze the broad aspect or scope of literature. Understanding the scope and nature of literature is helpful in helping us analyze how literature shapes society/the world and vice versa.

“[Moretti] has suggested that distant reading should supplant, not supplement, close reading.”
Though I see the value in distant reading, I don’t see the value or point in supplanting close reading with distant reading. Close reading can limit us as those who study literature, but distant reading can also limit us. If we merely performed distant reading, we may make incorrect assumptions about books and literature. We would just be looking at concepts that may not make sense without the details and context that close reading provides. Close reading and distant reading should be able to work and function together to help us understand literature and society.
Jocker’s Reading
“A macroanalytic approach helps us not only to see and understand the operations of a larger “literary economy,” but, by means of scale, to better see and understand the degree to which literature and the individual authors who manufacture that literature respond to or react against literary and cultural trends.” - Page 28
At first I did not realize how the issue of any “macro” concept related to literary history or literary studies. However this passage’s explanation of the effects of macroanalytics on analysis of cultural trends helped me understand. This macro approach to literature and culture helps us to think of new ways in which to think about the creators of the literature we consume and how they are affected by literary and cultural trends. Rather than simply thinking about the literature we consume, it is also important to think about who is constructing this literature and thus constructing our ideas about society and culture. 
“There was controversy when we came to discuss the “critical enterprise” and what it means to engage in literary research.” - Page 5
In this passage, the concept that seems to be the most unclear is “critical enterprise.” It does not appear that this concept was fully explained. Clearly, it exists in relation to research but I’m not sure what else it means. I understand what these words mean separately but I feel as if they have a different meaning when paired together, and I do not really understand the meaning. 

Moretti Reading
“And then, a field this large cannot be understood by stitching together separate bits of knowledge about individual cases, because it isn’t a sum of individual cases: it’s a collective system, that should be grasped as such, as a whole—and the graphs that follow are one way to begin doing this...A more rational literary history. That is the idea.” 
The part about this passage that I would like to discuss more is when Moretti implies that distant reading and graphs constitute a more literary history. How can one person suggest what is and is not rational? Some people may believe that stitching together knowledge is more rational than the collective system that Moretti refers to. It seems as if what is more rational is more of an opinion rather than a fact. 
“The old historical paradigm, writes Krzysztof Pomian, ‘directed the gaze of the historian towards extraordinary events . . . historians resembled collectors: both gathered only rare and curious objects, disregarding whatever looked banal, everyday, normal.’”
While reading about Moretti’s theories, I have been wondering what inspired him to come up with them. This passage provides context and a point of origin for his theories. He seems to be interested in old historians and their fascination with special events and literature rather than a collective nature or scope of literature.
