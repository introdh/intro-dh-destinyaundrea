### 2017-09-18: Distant reading

New York Times Reading

“We need distant reading, Moretti argues, because its opposite, close reading, can’t uncover the true scope and nature of literature.”

Moretti believes that rather than helping us as readers, close reading can actually hinder us because we will have details rather than a full scope of literature. I was confused as to why Moretti would think this from merely the definition of distant reading. This did help make his point clearer.. As readers, many times we do get wrapped up in the details of books and then forget to analyze the broad aspect or scope of literature. Understanding the scope and nature of literature is helpful in helping us analyze how literature shapes society/the world and vice versa.

“[Moretti] has suggested that distant reading should supplant, not supplement, close reading.”

Though I see the value in distant reading, I don’t see the value or point in supplanting close reading with distant reading. Close reading can limit us as those who study literature, but distant reading can also limit us. If we merely performed distant reading, we may make incorrect assumptions about books and literature. We would just be looking at concepts that may not make sense without the details and context that close reading provides. Close reading and distant reading should be able to work and function together to help us understand literature and society.

Jocker’s Reading

“A macroanalytic approach helps us not only to see and understand the operations of a larger “literary economy,” but, by means of scale, to better see and understand the degree to which literature and the individual authors who manufacture that literature respond to or react against literary and cultural trends.” - Page 28

At first I did not realize how the issue of any “macro” concept related to literary history or literary studies. However this passage’s explanation of the effects of macroanalytics on analysis of cultural trends helped me understand. This macro approach to literature and culture helps us to think of new ways in which to think about the creators of the literature we consume and how they are affected by literary and cultural trends. Rather than simply thinking about the literature we consume, it is also important to think about who is constructing this literature and thus constructing our ideas about society and culture. 

“There was controversy when we came to discuss the “critical enterprise” and what it means to engage in literary research.” - Page 5

In this passage, the concept that seems to be the most unclear is “critical enterprise.” It does not appear that this concept was fully explained. Clearly, it exists in relation to research but I’m not sure what else it means. I understand what these words mean separately but I feel as if they have a different meaning when paired together, and I do not really understand the meaning. 

Moretti Reading

“And then, a field this large cannot be understood by stitching together separate bits of knowledge about individual cases, because it isn’t a sum of individual cases: it’s a collective system, that should be grasped as such, as a whole—and the graphs that follow are one way to begin doing this...A more rational literary history. That is the idea.” 

The part about this passage that I would like to discuss more is when Moretti implies that distant reading and graphs constitute a more literary history. How can one person suggest what is and is not rational? Some people may believe that stitching together knowledge is more rational than the collective system that Moretti refers to. It seems as if what is more rational is more of an opinion rather than a fact. 

“The old historical paradigm, writes Krzysztof Pomian, ‘directed the gaze of the historian towards extraordinary events . . . historians resembled collectors: both gathered only rare and curious objects, disregarding whatever looked banal, everyday, normal.’”

While reading about Moretti’s theories, I have been wondering what inspired him to come up with them. This passage provides context and a point of origin for his theories. He seems to be interested in old historians and their fascination with special events and literature rather than a collective nature or scope of literature. 


### 2017-09-25: Topic modeling I

Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction

“Topic modeling is a form of text mining, a way of identifying patterns in a corpus. You take your corpus and run it through a tool which groups words across the corpus into ‘topics’.” 

Here, it seems as if topic modeling is very similar to distant reading. Would it be safe to say that topic modeling and distant reading are interchangeable terms and concepts or are they completely separate?

“How the actual topic modeling programs is determined by mathematics. Many topic modeling articles include equations to explain the mathematics, but I personally cannot parse them.”

Maybe topic modeling and distant reading are not as similar as I thought. While distant reading is more about understanding literary history, it seems as if topic modeling has more of a foundation in mathematics and equations. 

The Digital Humanities Contribution to Topic Modeling

“The humanities is unused to such formal simulacra, however, and so a journal about scholarship might appear to be a journal about tools and software. But none of the authors in this issue simply run and accept the results as “useful” or “interesting” for humanities scholarship. Instead, they critically wrestle with the process. Their work is done with as much of a focus on what the computational techniques obscure as reveal.”

While topic modeling seems to be heavily related to mathematical equations, it still has a humanities background. Not only are they discussing and analyzing the math aspect of it, but also the process and the obscurities of the process.

“Because topic modeling transforms or compresses free data (raw narrative text) into structured data (topics as a ratio of word tokens and their strength of representation in documents) it is tempting to think of it as “solving” text.”

The concept I don’t understand here is “word tokens.” Initially I thought that it simply just meant words but when I looked it up, the definition was much more complex and confusing. I would like to discuss this more.


Text Analysis of Martha Ballard’s Diary

“For the purposes of this particular program, it was more important to distill words into a basic unit rather than maintain the complexity of capitalized characters. Once the data was scrubbed, we could turn to writing a program that would count the number of deliveries recorded in the diary.”

This seems to be very similar, or the same, to tidying data. Tidying or “scrubbing” data is important to make sure that all the data is consistent in its form and able to be collapsed, combined with, or compared to other data. 

“The discrepancies between the program’s tally of deliveries and Ulrich’s delivery count speak to broader issues in “digital” text mining versus “manual” text mining.”

Does this mean that digital or manual text mining is more efficient? Would it be best to just use both of these methods and compare the results or just choose one method?


What Can Topic Models of PMLA Teach Us About the History of Literary Scholarship?

“But we’ve reached a shared sense that topic modeling can enrich the history of literary scholarship by revealing trends that are presently invisible.”

This is, what I view as, the main objective of concepts such as topic modeling and distant reading. By simply doing close reading, it is almost impossible to examine all of the trends that have been present throughout literary history. However, with methods such as these, it is easier for scholars to examine trends and compare them to literary trends and society now. 

“Of course a topic can also be a subject category — modeling PMLA, we have found topics that are primarily “about Beowulf” or “about music.” Or a topic can be a group of words that tend to co-occur because they’re associated with a particular critical approach.”

I am still having trouble fully grasping the concept of topic modeling. Is a “topic” the amount of times a word or phrase shows up in various works? Or is it more complex? It seems to be the latter as this reading discusses subject categories, etc. 


### 2017-10-02: Topic Modeling II

Mining the Dispatch

“The real potential of topic modeling, however, isn't at the level of the individual document. Topic modeling, instead, allows us to step back from individual documents and look at larger patterns among all the documents, to practice not close but distant reading, to borrow Franco Moretti's memorable phrase.”

Last week I wondered if topic modeling was similar to distant reading or if they were related at all. I initially concluded that the answer was no because topic modeling seemed to have more of a mathematical background than a humanities background. However, our class discussion and this passage confirm that the answer is yes, they are certainly similar and related.

Though this is not necessarily a passage, these is a section of the website that is titled “Threshold” and allows you to set the threshold to a certain percent to adjust the graph. 

What exactly is the threshold in topic modeling? Is it specific to this Dispatch project or is it a concept in topic modeling as a whole?

Signs at 40

“Because topics are models of word usage, the term topic is misleadingly narrow. The patterns of language are often better described as discourses, topoi, or rhetorical frames. The attraction of topic modeling is precisely its capacity to capture (if only approximately) these central concepts of cultural and political analysis.”

I think this is a good description of topic modeling. The word “topic” can be confusing when thinking about this method of data analysis. However, it makes more sense to discuss in relation to how we apply it to our knowledge about discourse and rhetoric throughout history. 

“Because we model only the co-occurrence of words, it is possible for “topics” not to be perfectly coherent semantically....Another possibility is the “intrusion” of a word into a topic where it seems out of place. This has the result of linking articles in which that intrusive word is prominent with a topic in a potentially misleading way.”

What is the damage that could be done by issues such as these intrusive words? What happens if we end up viewing a word as a topic when it is really not? Could this influence what we think was a pattern during a time in literary history? What are the consequences of this?

Text Analysis of Trump’s Tweets

“My analysis, shown below, concludes that the Android and iPhone tweets are clearly from different people, posting during different times of day and using hashtags, links, and retweets in distinct ways. What’s more, we can see that the Android tweets are angrier and more negative, while the iPhone tweets tend to be benign announcements and pictures.”

It’s interesting that text analysis can show patterns like this. Because it has been shown/proven that Trump uses a Samsung Galaxy, this makes a think about the difference between the angry, wild things he tweets and the more toned down tweets from his employees. 

“A lot has been written about Trump’s mental state. But I’d really rather get inside the head of this anonymous staffer, whose job is to imitate Trump’s unique cadence (“Very sad!”), or to put a positive spin on it, to millions of followers. Are they a true believer, or just a cog in a political machine, mixing whatever mainstream appeal they can into the @realDonaldTrump concoction?”

What does this say about the state of our government? Not only do we have Trump making ridiculous tweets, but also people that he has hired to tweet like him.

Data Miners

“Text mining aims to shed light on authorship and the creative process by examining word
patterns in individual books…”

In our discussions of text analysis and mining so far, we have discussed it mostly in reference to patterns over time. However, it is interesting to think about how it also reflects the patterns of specific authors and their creativity.

“At the climax of “Mockingbird,” Ms. Lee’s voice as a writer is less distinct than at any other point in the novel, the researchers said.”

Does text mining truly have the ability to distinguish between different voices of writers? How are the distinctions between the different writers/writing styles actually determined?

### 2017-10-23: Mapping: A Critical Introductin

Beyond GIS

“But humanities scholarship increasingly reflects what may in fact, by the greatest legacy of postmodernism, the acknowledgment that our understanding of the world itself is socially constructed.” 

This is something that I haven’t thought about in depth. As we study the world through a humanities lens, we are studying how the world is socially constructed. 

“At its core, GIS is a powerful software that uses location to integrate and visualize information.”

I would like to discuss how this compares to the other analysis software and techniques we have been discussing in class this semester. 

What is Spatial History?

“Visualization and spatial history are not about producing illustrations or maps to communicate things that you have discovered by other means. It is a means of doing research; it generates questions that might otherwise go unasked…”

Here, it does seem as if GIS has similar purposes as other techniques we have studied this semester. 

“Thus GIS often ends up emphasizing not the constructed-ness of space but rather its given-ness…”

What is the difference between constructed-ness and given-ness? Would it be similar to the difference between connotation and denotation?

Crampton - Mapping

“Perhaps most arresting is the increasing separation of GIS and mapping from geography as a whole.” - 2

So it seems as if GIS and mapping are becoming more conceptual rather than geography-based.

“If the theoretical critique cleared conceptual space for alternative mappings, it has fallen to a variety of practitioners, most of them outside the academy…”

How would one “clear” conceptual space?

What is GIS?

“GIS allows us to view, understand, question, interpret, and visualize our world in ways that reveal relationships, patterns, and trends in the form of maps, globes, reports, and charts.”

It seems as if GIS does for geography what software such as Mallet does for text. 

“GIS benefits organizations of all sizes and in almost every industry. There is a growing interest in and awareness of the economic and strategic value of GIS.”

Will GIS be able to keep up with the ever changing world of technology and technological neesd of various industries?
