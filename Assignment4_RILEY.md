CENTRALITY PLOT

<p>Though a network originally meant “a net-like arrangement of threads, wires, etc.” it has more modernly come to stand for “complex, interlocking system [of] stuff and relationships” (Weingart, Demystifying Networks, 2011). A network is primarily made up of nodes/vertices and edges. Nodes have attributes, such as a title or a page number (Weingart, Demystifying Networks, 2011).  The nodes or vertices represent the actual “stuff” or data and the edges display the connection(s) between the data. In this assignment, I used data from numerous Supreme Court cases. The Supreme Court cases were put into categories and the categories were assigned numbers. I chose the following numbers/categories: 20040 - desegregation (other than as pertains to school desegregation, employment discrimination, and affirmative action); 20060 - employment discrimination: on basis of race, age, religion, illegitimacy, national origin, or working conditions; 20080 - sit-in demonstrations (protests against racial discrimination in places of public accommodation). I felt these three issues would have the most, or some of the most, connections out of all the data. In my network, the edges represent links between cases where one case cited the other case in the decision. In my network, each node consists of the name of the court case, the year of the case, and the USID number assigned to the case. I used R to make an interactive plot of my data to display the network. The plotted data was color coded six different ways to make six different plots. The six different plots are as follows: year, vote, issue, centrality, cluster, and gatekeeper. I chose to analyze the plots of year, issue, and centrality. Out of all six plots, I felt these these three truly captured the story of the connections of the cases. The “year” plot is color coded by which year the case was decided in. The color scale is from purple to yellow, with purple being 1950 and prior and yellow meaning 2000 and later. The “issue” plot uses green, red, and blue to represent the three different categories of desegregation, employment discrimination, and sit-in demonstrations. The “centrality” plot color scale is from purple to yellow, with purple being less than 25% centrality and lower and yellow being 100% centrality. Centrality is a measure of the number of connections that one node has to other nodes. In this case, it would be the number of connections one case has to other cases.</p>


<p>In terms of years, the cases in these three categories appear to be very connected. It is safe to argue cases within close decades (i.e. the 1950s and 1960s) were most likely cited by each other a great deal because they dealt with the same issues during this time of increased attention on Civil Rights. This would be interesting to look at to further analyze the data and how it was being used in various cases. Would some of these cases have been as strong if they had not cited other Supreme Court cases? Hypothetically, what kinds of effects would different outcomes of these cases have on society? In regards to the issue plot, I wonder what specific details in a cited case made the case worth citing. As expected, case rulings in the same category were cited in cases dealing with the same issue. For example, desegregation cases were more likely to be cited in other desegregation cases as opposed to being cited in a sit-in demonstration case. Out of all three issues I selected to plot, the two that seem to be the most connected are sit-in demonstrations and desegregation. Desegregation seems to be the most central topic, as it is the one that connects with the most cases of sit-in demonstrations as well as employment discrimination. The topic of centrality brings me to my next plot, the centrality plot. The most central case seems to be Centrenada v. Partida. Though this data shows us the connections between the most central case and the rest of the cases in this plot, it is hard to truly see all of the connections as the edges of the plot are very intertwined and complicated. Though I have discussed various arguments and questions, I believe the most prevalent argument the data conveys is that issues of Civil Rights have been very prevalent in Supreme Court cases from the 1940s to now. 
  
  
Network analysis provides us with many possibilities to explore humanities concepts and ideas. The main benefit of it is that we are able to see connections that we may have not been able to recognize otherwise. Using networks, we can “see how documents relate to one another, how they relate to topics, how topics are related to each other, and how all of those are related to words.” (Weingart, Topic Modeling and Network Analysis, 2015). Specifically in my project, the “documents” were court cases. The network helped me to see how the cases were related to each other, how they related to the three issues I chose, and how the topics themselves were connected. One of the biggest general possibilities of network analysis is that it works well with other humanities methods/concepts. For example, networks analysis creates new knowledge when it is paired with a geographic map. When simply looking at a map, we cannot always see connections between different locations or between characteristics of places. However, network analysis of geographic maps provide us with at-a-glance synthesis of large scales of information [and] learning something new about areas one is not yet an expert in” (Weingart, Contextualizing networks with maps, 2011). 


Though there are possibilities of network analysis, there are also some limitations. As I discussed earlier, the network displays connections between cases but does not provide specific details that show how the court cases are related, other than the issues/categories. A network on its own is a “set of meaningless relationships without a knowledge of what travels through and across it, what entities make it up, and how that network interacts with the larger world” (Weingart, Contextualizing networks with maps, 2011). We have to make sure we contextualize networks so that we can begin to use them to create meaning and knowledge. Without context, the networks cannot do much for the humanities because it is just simply data. Another limitation of network analysis is that it is not always effective when it is dealing with a large of amount of different types of information. Network analysis is typically used by computer scientists working with only a few types of information. However, humanities scholars often deal with “interactions of many types of things, and so the algorithms developed for traditional network studies are insufficient for the networks we often have” (Weingart, Demystifying Networks, 2011). The lack of compatibility can definitely affect the type of network analysis that can be done, thus affecting the ways we introduce new connections into the humanities. 


Overall, the concept of network analysis is quite interesting if you are interested in looking at connections. However, to truly benefit from network analysis, further contextualization and analysis should definitely be done.
