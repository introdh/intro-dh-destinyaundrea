<p>Georeferencing consists of matching a basemap to a second map (example - a scanned, historic map) with points. The maps have to be lined up with each other and then points are made in the same place on each, with there being various point matches across the maps. With this process, we associate locations on both maps. 
  
I worked with a georectified map of Los Angeles, California. Since the maps from *Mapping Inequality* already had over 1,000 points, we used this map for the lab rather than using our own. My georectified map is a map that matches the sections of Los Angeles on the base map with the Los Angeles map from *Mapping Inequality*. The *Mapping Inequality* maps represent how areas of cities were “graded” during the period of redlining around the time of the New Deal in the 1930s and 1940s. On the maps, different areas have various grades and corresponding colors. During this time, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board developed a program to look at economic conditions, real estate trends, and racial and ethnic patterns in residential areas of the country’s largest cities (Amy Hillier, Redlining in Philadelphia, 2002). For this program, the Board had to establish standards to give the areas a grade. These standards were supposed to imply demand for housing. However, they ended up causing the issue of redlining. Areas with the lowest grades, such as a “D,” were considered hazardous and assigned the color red. These areas had “low homeownership rates, poor housing conditions, and an ‘undesirable population or an infiltration of it,’ referring largely to African Americans and Jews” (Amy Hillier, Redlining in Philadelphia, 2002). The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation practically caused redlining as it shared these grades with the Federal Housing Administration and private lenders who then, in turn, avoided these areas with low grades when deciding which areas should be provided with mortgages and loans.

On my map of Los Angeles, the two colors shown the most are yellow and red, implying that many areas were given below average to low grades during this time. While areas such as Beverly Hills received overwhelming A grades, areas such as Watts received C and D grades. From common knowledge of the Los Angeles area, these grades would most likely be given today if the grading was done again. Residential neighborhoods in areas like Beverly Hills are still affluent and have a majority white demographic. Neighborhoods in Watts still have a majority minority demographic. I have a few questions about this comparison of the past to the present state of Los Angeles areas. If it was not for redlining during the New Deal, would these areas still be the same in terms of racial demographics, wealth, crime, etc.? What were these areas like decades before they were assigned these grades? Do the people currently living in these neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area know how they are affected by the past of redlining? Are the principles of redlining perpetuated in different ways in the present time? It is clear that the past is certainly affecting the present in this instance. 

On the map of Los Angeles on *Mapping Inequality*, the area of Watts had a total of over 50% black and Hispanic and Latino people residing in the area. According to *Social Explorer*, Watts is now over 80% black and Hispanic and Latino. In Beverly Hills on *Mapping Inequality*, the demographics were listed as having 0% black people and 0% foreign people, implying that the areas were overwhelmingly made up of white residents. *Social Explorer* shows the majority of the residents of Beverly Hills being white, as they make up 80% of the area. In these two examples, not too much has changed in terms of racial demographics. There were more black people during the New Deal in Watts than there are now. In Watts, the majority seems to have always been some racial minority. Now there are more Hispanic and Latino residents. However, Beverly Hills still remains predominantly white, just as it was during the time of redlining. 

One of the most interesting things to me is the benefits of spatial analysis. Through it, we are able to see what effects different policies, occurrences, structures, etc. have had on cities, towns, areas, neighborhoods, etc. This spatial narrative is a “geography of the constant interactions between structure and process, a continuous interplay between society and the individual and/or group within a spatial environment that both shapes and is shaped by social norms and individual group agency” (Bodenhamer, Beyond GIS, 2013). Through spatial analysis, we are able to see how various groups of people and places have been affected and how they are still being affected today.

In Bodenhamer’s piece, he describes deep mapping as moving the user “from the GIS world of observation to one of habitation where the material world is experienced through our own embodiment and sense of being in the world” (Bodenhamer, Beyond GIS, 2013). I got a small feel of this while doing this project, as I could feel myself becoming connected with the different maps, areas, and demographics I looked at. I would like to look at other projects that utilize deep mapping. 

In terms of representing space and place, the main limitation I see is that mapping is political. When thinking about it, “it is hard to imagine mapping that does not in some way or other involve politics, mapping is itself a political act” (Crampton, Mapping, 2010). Because it will always be political, there will always be bias involved. That can always be a critique someone makes about a map, specifically in terms of georeferencing. Some people’s way of representing space and place will always be different than someone else’s, and this will inherently cause conflict and disagreement because of the political nature behind the mapping. It would be interesting to think of a way where mapping would not involve any bias in the future, but I’m not sure if we will ever fully get to that point. Though we may not get to that point, it is certainly interesting to think about. </p>
