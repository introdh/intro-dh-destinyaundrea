## Question/ Abstract

Here in your repository, write your answers to the following: 

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project. 

In my final project, I am attempting to find the answers to the following questions: What words have been in the most popular Hip-Hop/Rap songs over time? What words make the songs popular? What subjects/topics make the songs popular? What subjects/themes/topics/ideas are most represented in these songs? What has been the trend in these popular subjects changing over time? Have the trends of popular subjects in Hip-Hop/Rap songs changed over time?


(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the projectâ€™s principal activities and its expected results.

The characterstics of a strong abstract:

- explains the humanities question(s) guiding the project
- includes the DH methods that will be used and why
- identifies which humanities fields/ disciplines the project is engaged in 

In my final project, I will be studying the change in content of Hip-Hop/Rap songs from 1985-2015. the main question I aim to answer is "How has the content of popular Hip-Hop/Rap songs changed over the past 30 years?" For this project, I will use the software R to make a topic model of the words that appear most in the songs. This method will show me the most popular words in popular Hip-Hop/Rap songs and help me infer what subjects have been discussed in these songs over time. Through this method, I will be able to do a kind of distant reading to view overall changes in trends in this genre from 1985-2015.
