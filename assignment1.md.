For my data set, I wanted to look at any existing trends in the Billboard Hot 100 Songs chart. Over the years, I’ve noticed that the music industry is a very male dominated industry and only a few genres typically do well commercially. I thought this would be a good opportunity to examine the most popular songs right now and the artists of the songs. To do this, I looked at the top 30 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs chart. While the Billboard website served as my main and most important source, I also used iTunes and Wikipedia. I used the Billboard website to look at the Hot 100 Songs chart, the artist’s name, the song’s current chart position, and the number of weeks the song has been on the chart. I used iTunes to look at the song’s genre and the length or time of the song. I used Wikipedia to find out the artist’s gender, place of birth, race or ethnicity, and age. For the songs I had not heard before, I listened to them to figure out the language. As I expected, the majority of the artists in the top 30 are male artists. While there are 5 female artists in the top 30, there are 23 male artists (Khalid and Taylor Swift are in the top 30 twice). Also, the most dominant genres in the top 30 songs are pop and rap, combining to take up 20 songs out of 30. I also noticed that all of the artists in the top 30 are under the age of 40 years old, which is interesting to think about. Though I only looked at the chart for the week of what Billboard recognizes as the week of September 30th, I suspect that this is an accurate representation of what this chart has tended to look like over the past decade at minimum. These are some of the observations that I made and they raised many questions for me as I analyzed this data.
1.	Why is it typical for the majority of the artists in the Hot 100 songs to be white artists, and even more specifically, white men? As I previously stated, there are only five female artists in the top 30 songs. What does this say about society and our preferences as consumers of music? One could say that this data seems to reflect typical societal views that men are more important and more talented than women and that their work is more worthy of being recognized. 
2.	Not only are there barely any women, but there is only one black woman as the main artist of a song represented in the top 30. This shows that black women are not as represented in what is considered “mainstream” music as we should be.
3.	Another question that came to mind while collecting and analyzing this data is how  rap has become so mainstream overtime. Almost one-third of the songs in the top 30 are rap songs. It is interesting to think about how rap started off as a counterhegemonic genre of music and is now a major part of popular and dominant culture.
