## Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology

<p>I decided to study data from The _Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology_  I wanted to have an abundance of information to study for my topic model so I picked the word counts from the issues of this journal from 1990-2010. I felt this would give me enough information for this project, as it was around 1,000 issues of the journal. In terms of type of data, my goal was to see how often race was discussed in terms of law enforcement and criminal justice. I wanted to see if race was discussed in regards to issues such racial discrimination with police brutality, prison sentencing, treatment in prison, etc. We, as a society, tend to talk about the effect of race on situations of police brutality as if it has just started happening a few years ago. In reality, race has been a factor in discrimination in the entire criminal justice system since even before the actual criminal justice system was officially established. I hoped that these journal issues from 1990-2010 would tell a similar story or at least give some insight into how people were discussing race in criminal justice between 1990 and 2010.</p>

<p>The JStor data provided with me with twenty five topics from the issues of The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology between 1990-2010. I named them all because I feel as if they are all important and relevant to what was being discussed and focused on in terms of criminal justice and criminology during these two decades. The topics that have been formed are very interesting to look at. I noticed that one of the major trends seemed to be how the journal focused a great deal on violent crimes from 1990-2010. Words such as “rape,” “domestic violence,” “homicide,” and “murder” appeared as key terms in various topics in this model. The journal issues did not focus at all as much on non-violent crimes as it did on violent crimes. The only non-violent crimes it seemed to discuss are drug offenses and money laundering/fraud. Other than violent crimes, the journal issues mostly discussed and analyzed issues such as crime scene courtroom processes, prison sentencing, and various aspects of the constitution. In terms of crime scene and courtroom processes, the topics model suggests topics such as DNA evidence and juries were very popular from 1990-2010. In regard to the constitution, the topic model suggests topics such as amendments and code of conduct were discussed a great deal during this time. Race was mentioned in these journal issues, but not as much as I expected. It was mostly discussed in the “juvenile criminals” topic. I was expecting to see it more in relation to issues such as prison sentencing and punishment. This suggests that from 1990-2010, race was not necessarily discussed in the same ways that it is now. Today it is discussed in relation to police brutality and unfair prison sentencing. However, during 1990-2010, race seems to mostly have been discussed in relation to juvenile delinquency.</p>

<p>I would say that this is topic model is a good example of what I believe is the main possibility or benefit to topic modeling: the ability to “enrich the history of literary scholarship by revealing trends that are presently invisible” (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012). As I previously stated, I thought that race would be discussed more in relation to issues such as punishment in 1990-2010. However, these journal issues helped me see that that was not the case. Because of this, I now know what was actually popular rather than just making an assumption. It has helped me enriched my knowledge of how race was discussed in regard to criminal justice and criminology during these two decades by enlightening me on what I rendered invisible and false. Due to this, I can do more accurate analysis of race in these two decades because I have an accurate foundation of the trends of discussion during this time.</p>

<p>The main issue I see with topic modeling is how “because we model only the co-occurrence of words, it is possible for “topics” not to be perfectly coherent” (Mazzaschi, Signs at 40). I did notice this in some of the topics. Some words did seem out of place and made it slightly difficult for me to analyze some of the topics. This could be very dangerous to the study of humanities because if we happen to analyze a word that does not actually fit into a topic, we could mistake it for a trend during said time when really, it is irrelevant to the topic we are discussing because the word was misplaced.</p>

<p>Overall, this topic modeling experience was quite interesting and I am glad I picked this data set to observe and analyze.</p>
